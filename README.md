# Experiment No. 1

* Aim: To understand and implement the basic structure and syntax of a C++ program, including input/output operations, variables, and arithmetic operations.

* Theory:
C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. It is an extension of the C language and is widely used for system/software development and game programming. A basic C++ program helps beginners understand the foundational building blocks required for developing more complex applications. These building blocks include:

ðŸ”¹ 1. *Header Files*:
The line #include <iostream> is a preprocessor directive used to include the input/output stream library for using cin and cout.

ðŸ”¹ 2. *Namespace*:
using namespace std; allows the program to use standard C++ objects (like cout and cin) without prefixing them with std::.

ðŸ”¹ 3. *Main Function*:
Every C++ program must have a main() function. It is the entry point where execution begins.

ðŸ”¹ 4. *Variables and Data Types*:
Variables are used to store data.

ðŸ”¹ 5. *Input and Output*:
cout is used for output (printing to the screen).
cin is used for input (taking user input from the keyboard).

ðŸ”¹ 6. *Return Statement*

# Basic Arithmetic Operations(Calculator)

This program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using two integers entered by the user. It uses basic C++ features like cin, cout, variables, and arithmetic operators.

*ALGORITHM*

1> Start

2> Declare two integer variables: a, b

3>Take input for a and b using cin

4> Perform and display:
 Addition: a + b
 Subtraction: a - b
 Multiplication: a * b
 Division: a / b (assume b â‰  0)
 
5> End



Conclusion:
Through this experiment, we learned the basic structure and syntax of a C++ program. We understood how to use input/output statements (cin, cout), declare variables, and apply arithmetic operators. By creating a simple calculator, we practiced performing basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This experiment strengthened our foundational understanding of programming logic and the use of core C++ functions.
